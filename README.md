# Daily ArXiv

I liked the idea of [Daily ArXiv](https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/dailyarxiv) and wanted to rebuild it with React.js as an exercise.

Thank you to arXiv for use of its [open access interoperability](https://arxiv.org/help/api/index).

## todo

* check the physics category is properly handled in form
  * physics uses additional subcategories with different codes
* change up colors all around
* add search result info (categories, editable result count, etc)
* hover effect for results (overlay? box shadow?)
* optional date range instead of just one day
* add to result entry (pdf link, summary, etc)
