# Daily ArXiv

I liked the idea of [Daily ArXiv](https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/dailyarxiv) and wanted to rebuild it as an exercise.

Thank you to arXiv for use of its [open access interoperability](https://arxiv.org/help/api/index).

## About

* Built using Next.js and React
* MUI and JoyUI used for styling
* Stores preferences in localstorage
* Direct download pdf from search results

## Todo

* check the physics category is properly handled in form
  * physics uses additional subcategories with different codes
* change up colors?
* add search input info on results page (categories, dates, etc)
* optional date range instead of just one day
